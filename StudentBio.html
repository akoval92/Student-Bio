             <p>Hello fellow Earthlings! My name is Amber Marie Koval. I was born and raised in San Diego, California...kind of. I grew up in a small "census-designated place" (according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamul,_California">wikipedia)</a>. I attended Steele Canyon High School my freshman and sophomore years. It then became obvious that traditional high school would not get me to graduation. I began my junior year at the Altus Charter School of San Diego where I only had to attend classroom sessions twice per week. I also started a job at Subway where I became a shift leader at 17. Once I graduated high school and turned 18 I obtained a job at a high-end furniture store in Mission Valley, West Elm. I was hired as a cashier but management soon realized I was horrible at upselling and didn't push customers to buy extra products. They transferred me to the stockroom where I became a whole new, improved and happier employee. After a couple years I decided I needed to make a change and get on the path to a career. My wonderful mom suggested I take a stab at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phlebotomy">phlebotomy</a>. I attended a course at Family Health Services where I obtained my CPT1 license. In 2012 I was hired as a lab assistant at the Scripps Green Hospital Rapid Response Laboratory where, I am happy to say, I am still working. I have attained an abundence of experience throughout my career which, I believe, the most valuable of all is learning how to accommodate every type person at the most vulnerable times of their lives. I have gained so much knowledge, had so many great experiences, and have built relationships with some of the most caring and talented people in San Diego. While I have had a great time working in healthcare, I am ready to venure into a whole new realm of possible employment. My husband and I welcomed our beautiful daughter into the world November 1st, 2018. I'd had a desire to try something new for a long time but never did anything about it. Now I have every reason in the world. Every good parent wants to give their child the life they were never had and I am no exception. I may be inexperienced at the moment but I know two things for sure;  I learn quickly and I will have a sincere passion for any career I choose. I am truely grateful to everyone that has helped bring me to this point but I am the only person that will take myself further. </p>
